    <h4> My research aims to develop and unify techniques from both <br> <i>nonlinear control theory</i> and <i>machine learning</i> <br>to systematically achieve stable and robust robotic-assisted locomotion. This includes developing efficient methods of user customization via human-robot interaction as well as studying the efficacy of assisted locomotion in clinical settings.
