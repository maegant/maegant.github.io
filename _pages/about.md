Hi, my name is Maegan Tucker. I'm an <a href='https://research.gatech.edu/maegan-tucker'>Assistant Professor</a> at Georgia Tech (started January 2024). My research is centered around achieving stable and user-preferred locomotion using formal methods from both **nonlinear control theory** and **machine learning**, with specific applications towards **robotic assistive devices**. 
<!-- My research has been supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). -->
Aside from my research, I am deeply passionate about furthering DEI efforts within the robotics community. 
<!-- Towards this, I was involved in several Caltech DEI efforts such as [Future Ignited](https://sfp.caltech.edu/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-programs/futures-ignited), [Freshman Summer Research Institute (FSRI)](https://diversity.caltech.edu/programs-training/freshman-summer-research-institute-fsri), and [Rise Tutoring](https://www.caltechy.org/rise-tutor).  -->
If you are interested in discussing either my research, please reach out at ``mtucker@gatech.edu``!
