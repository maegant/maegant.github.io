## Research Assistant for IDREEM Lab
During the Fall semester of 2015 I worked as a part of the IDREEM lab to investigate the amount of students who used the Georgia Tech Makerspace as part of a longitudinal study.

I contributed to the research project by collecting data about the amount of students who used the 3D printer room at the Georgia Tech Invention Studio. I also analyzed this data and helped create a "people counter" system to use a security camera to automatically count the amount of students who used the room.
