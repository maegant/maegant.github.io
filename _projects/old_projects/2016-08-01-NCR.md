Over the course of three semesters (Fall 2014, Summer 2015, Spring 2016), I completed the co-operative program with NCR Corporation. During these semesters I worked full-time as a Mechanical Engineering intern working in product design and product development.

I worked closely with a team of 2 Mechanical Engineers and 3 Electrical Engineers. As a part of the engineering team, I also completed many smaller projects and tasks including electrical technical work such as soldering and creating cables, part modification using machining equipment, creating manufacturing and customer documents, and certification testing.

The main design project that I worked on was the design, prototyping, testing, and manufacturing of the P1535/P1235 Point of Sale Terminals. Images of this product can be seen below.
