My graphics editor of course (which I use to make figures) is Inkscape. Basically, Inkscape is just a free and versatile vector graphics editor. Also, there is a plugin called `TexText` that allows you to insert and edit latex equations which is suuuper handy for presentations and papers. To install inkscape/textext, I recommend following the instructions listed [here](https://textext.github.io/textext/install/linux.html). Specifically, I did the following:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:inkscape.dev/stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install inkscape
```
Then, to install TexText I did the following. First, I installed and upated the following LaTeX tools:
```
sudo apt-get install -y texlive-latex-base
sudo apt-get install -y texlive-fonts-recommended
sudo apt-get install -y texlive-fonts-extra
sudo apt-get install -y texlive-latex-extra
sudo apt install -y gir1.2-gtksource-3.0
```
Then, I downloaded the tar file here: https://github.com/textext/textext/releases/download/1.8.2/TexText-Linux-1.8.2.tar.gz
```
cd $Extracted_Download
cd textext-1.8.2
python3 setup.py
```
